# Notes 200810

Basically losing type projections means losing opaque types, unless we'd pay the price of carrying around a value
of some system in every object, which is not feasible. And `erased` seems to have been erased from Dotty 0.26.

The two crucial opaque types are `S#Id` and `S#Acc`, which are closely related. For example, if we change
`Mutable[S#Id, S#Tx]` to `Mutable[T, Ident[T]]` or so, then `tx.newIdentifierMap` cannot use `tx.Id` but must assume
`Ident[T]`, and consequently each opaque type that is a plain data structure must become a transparent type that
carries methods, which is indeed ugly. So `tx.neadVar` becomes `id.readVar`, for example. The id map is more tricky.

We would probably have to retrofit the serial library as well, to have `read(in, tx)(tx.acc)` or something similar,
unless we store the current `acc` in the transaction, which is a no-go as it implies a performance hit (we need to
use a stack).

In short, Dotty is a shit show so far; plus cross-building means we get the worst of both worlds.

If you're running Linux you shouldn't have problems compiling portaudio, though I recommend using the cvs-version
V18-patch which contains some good features and fixes.

On MacOsX it is a bit tricky to compile a dylib or static lib.
The official recommendation is building portaudio into the program itself.
Due to portability reasons I decided against that.
Use my supplied makefile (src/portaudio) to produce a decent library.

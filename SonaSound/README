SonaSound is a realtime Sound-Analysis and visualization program.

A tutorial is a few pages down!

QUICKINSTALL:
cd SonaSound-X.Y.Z.A
./configure
make
make install

(Or in case of old autoconf:
  ./configure
  cd src
  make
  make install
	)


FEATURES:
- Waveform-Display
- short-time-spectrum
- sonogram
- spectrum-generation switchable between lpc and fft
- Major kinds of windowing functions choosable
  - Different kinds of windowing functions are directly comparable via live-switching
	- Overlap of 50% can be switched on and off without stopping
- Buffer-Size and FFT-Size freely adjustable
- All Displays work from soundfile while playing or direct live-input from soundcard
- Comparison of different spectrum-generation-mehtods via multiple instances fo SonaSound possible

REQUIREMENTS:
If your computer has got 500 MHz or more, go ahead, if less, forget it!

SonaSound was succesfully tested on the following systems:
- Athlon 700, SuSE-7.3
- Athlon-XP 1600+ gentoo-1.4
- Duron 900 debian sarge
- Pentium III 800 debian woody
- G3 500 (PowerBook) gentoo-1.4
- G3 500 (PowerBook) MacOsX 10.2.[3-4]
- G3 500 (iBook) debian woody
- G4 933 (Quicksilver) MacOsX 10.2.[3-4]
- G4 933 (Quicksilver) SuSE-7.3
- 4 * Sparcv9 480 (Sun4u) Solaris-2.8

It should run on any other UNIX as well, as long as you manage to get portaudio installed.



Libraries needed:
- fftw (www.fftw.org)
- glib >= 1.2
- gtk >= 1.2
- gtkglarea
- GL
- GLU
- portaudio (www.portaudio.com)
- sndfile >= 1.0.1

CC/Binutils:
-Use gcc >=3.2
-When using gcc-2.9* be prepared to get many, many warnings when compiling
-use the newest Binutils

CFLAGS:
Try first without giving your own CFLAGS. My configure-script *should* detect good and sensible FLAGS.
If you don't like my choice, run configure like this:
# > CFLAGS="-whatever" ./configure

generic:
-O3 -ffast-math -pipe

try:
-fschedule-insns2 -fexpensive-optimizations -funsafe-math-optimizations

intel/AMD:
-march=<your-cpu> (eg athlon-xp)
-mmmx (if you have MMX)
-msse -mfpmath=sse (if you have SSE)
-m3dnow (if you have 3DNow)

PowerPC:

look into /proc/cpuinfo to find out what CPU you're running:
There must be a line like "cpu : 750"
If this line contains the word altivec (most likely with a cpu greater than 7400), use the altivec-switch.

-march=powerpc -mcpu={750,7400,7450} -mhard-float
"-maltivec -mabi=altivec" on Linux "-faltivec" on OsX (autodetected)
On G3: "-mmultiple" helps a bit
try:
"-mpowerpc-gpopt -mpowerpc-gfxopt -mstring"

TODO:

- Save sonogram-plot to bitmap-file (via glBitmap()-calls) for all our musicologist-friends
- Put different kinds of grid over the sonogram (staff-lines, note-names, frequency-grid)
- Let the user draw inside the sonogram/fft-view and resynthesize...
- make it multiple-channel / multiple-settings on same channels
- make it faster

- Switching from Soundfile to Soundcard Input:
	+ Click "Close Devices" to activate the Togglebutton "Use Soundfile"
	+ Click "Open Devices" to reactivate the transport controls

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- What it does:

  * Check for OpenGL-support, set up windows, measure fastest FFT-method or 
	  read it from wisdom-file
  * start Audio-Engine in new thread and calculate FFT or LPC from the given
	  Buffer-Size (Windows are applied to either the number of samples in one 
		Buffer or to the number of samples corresponding to the number of 
		FFT-points, whatever is smaller)
  * Draw WaveForm, FFT-View and one Sonogram-strip every time a new audio-buffer
	  arrives. Shift Sonogram one pixel to the left and discard the leftmost strip
  * LPC: autoregressive calculation of the filter-coefficients followed by
	  frequency response with half the number of FFT-points 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Caveats:

  * LPC-calculation takes quite a long time, be careful on slow 
	  (less than 700MHz) systems.
  * memmove is slow on MacOsX: Don't choose too large a buffer.
  * Textures under Linux are limited to sizes of powers of two, so making the 
	  sonogram-view too large for your graphics card (typically larger than 
		512 by 512 or 1024 by 1024) may give you a white window and lots of 
		error-messages.
 -> Solution: make the window smaller! This is an OpenGL-limitation 
		(More exactly a MESA-limitation) and doesn't apply on MacOsX, 
		because there I'm using a different way of Blitting
  * Resizing the window when playing garbles the sonogram-view, 
	  because there is no way of knowing what happens inside the graphics-card-memory.
  * Large values (>=512) for the number of LPC-coefficients together 
	  with large values for the number of FFT-points (>=4096) slows the display 
		down to unusable.
 -> Solution: choose a larger buffer (then the redrawing doesn't happen that often)
		or a smaller number of FFT-points.
  * The calculation of the waveform takes a long time, because of the large amount
	  of data to be processed.
 -> Solution: choose a smaller range of seconds to be displayed or a larger buffer.
  * Switching from File-input to Soundcard-input requires closing the sounddevice
 -> Solution: For performance reasons I have to reallocate lots of buffers.
		so no soultion ATM.
  * On PPC-computers stopping the playing results in an endless repeating of the
	  last buffer.
 -> Solution: This seems to be a portaudio version18-patch bug. 
		Close the device or restart the playing.

- What the Parameters mean:

  In (brackets) are the command line pendants.
	
 +SamplingRate (-s) Set the Samplingrate to specified float in Hz
  Only adjustable when the sound devices are closed.

 +FFT Size (-f oder -a) Set the number (-a) of FFT-Points (integer) 
  the toggle-button next to it means rounding the figure to the next
	power of two (-f)

 +Buffer Size (-p) Set the Audio-buffer size to specified integer
  Only adjustable when the sound devices are closed.
  the toggle-button next to it means rounding the figure to the next
	power of two

 +Window Type (-w) Choose the windowing function
  On the commandline you have to specify the following digits:
	
  * 0:Hamming

  * 1:Hanning (default)

  * 2:Blackman

  * 3:Bartlett

  * 4:Kaiser

 +Reference A (-b) Frequency in Hz for the reference-A used for displaying the 
  staff-lines

 +Waveform Range (-S) Maximum number of seconds to keep in Waveform-buffer.
  this is not accessible via the GUi, because the implications on the program 
	are too great to allow this while running (the value is clamped to the range
	1-20 sec)

 +AudioIn Device (-D) Choose Audio-device to be used for input (numbered from
  0)
  Only adjustable when the sound devices are closed.

  signals
  Only adjustable when the sound devices are closed.

 +HighPass (-H) Switch the highpass-filter (1st order) on or off to clean the
  spectral display
	
 +Draw Staff-Lines (-n) Switch Staff-lines on or off. 

 +Use Soundfile (-F) Use a file for analysing instead of soundcard input
  Only adjustable when the sound devices are closed.

 +Help (-h) displays basic help for command-line-options

-The Buttons

 +The functions  not available are grayed out. Try stopping or closing devices
  to access buttons you cannot reach.

 +Draw:  Draw the current buffer once.

 +Start:  Start the Audio-engine

 +Stop:  Stop the Audio-engine

 +Start Drawing:  Start displaying the buffers in Sync to the audio

 +Stop Drawing:  Stoppe displaying the buffers

 +Start All:  Start audio and Drawing (KeypadEnter)

 +Stop All:  Stop audio and Drawing (Keypad 0)

 +Close Devices:  Close the audio-devices to allow for second instance of the
 SonaSound or another program to use the device. Or for switching between different devices.

 +Open Devices: Open chosen Audio-device. When using a Soundfile for input
 only the output-channels will be openen and vv.

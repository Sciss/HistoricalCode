# HIDTest

This is a small project where I'm trying to figure out how to sense the WACOM tablet on Linux. It uses the Javahidapi library.

Unfortunately I can't seem to be able to open the tablet device; I remember this has to do with the tablet being used as a regular mouse device (at least after installing the regular Linux WACOM drivers). So I have to come back to this at another occasion and figure out how to 'unload' the system-wide WACOM driver.

# Historical Code

This began as just a "backup" of various code I found lying around on backup hard drives.

It then became a repository collecting "completed experiments" for which I generally no longer need to access their original repositories, but wish to keep the history of the development,
i.e. for research purposes.

I don't know if anything is useful for anyone.

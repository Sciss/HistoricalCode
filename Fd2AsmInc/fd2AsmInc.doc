›1mfdAsmInc›0m, a ›1mTropicDesign›0m product,  is used to convert .fd-files into assembler-
includefiles; you need OS2.0!

Holger Rutz (that's me...),  this conditions have  to be followed to distribute
it:
- the copying-fee may not be higher than $2 (inclusive disk, exclusive postage
  +packing).
- the following files have to be kept together in one directory:
    ›3m fd2AsmInc              ›0m(the executable)
    ›3m fd2AsmInc.doc          ›0m(the English doc-file)

    ›3m fd2AsmInc.asm          ›0m(the assembler-source)
  These files must be remain unmodified;  of course,  the filenotes,  the dates
  and the protect-bits may be changed. What about copying the icons, too?

›42m-- About the program ----------------------------------------------------- 3 --›0m

I had the idea of  this program when  I decrunched the OS2.0 assembler-includes
- because there are  no includefiles for  the libraries since includeversion 36
any longer. The _LVO-definitions are in the *** link-libraries now. Because
on the one hand I was unable to link these libraries with my object-code (BLink
always gurued) and on  the other hand  I had no desire  to start a linker every
time I assembled something (I'm using AsmOne), I created the assembler-includes
from the .fd-files.  Afterwards I wrote this program,  so you don't have  to do
this hard work  yourself.  It translates any .fd-files  into assembler-includes
(using the standard _LVO-definitions). This is the usage:
›3m
fd2AsmInc <from> [<to>] [comments] [spaces] [tabs <1-65535>] [dec] [hex]

<from>      ›0mName of the .fd-file (may contain wildcards);›3m
<to>        ›0mName of the includefile to be created or the target directory;›3m
<comments>  ›0mif you set  this switch,  all comments  found in the  .fd-file will
            also appear in the include-file.›3m
spaces      ›0mspaces are used to format the include-file.›3m
tab <size>  ›0msame as›3m spaces›0m, only that tabulators of the size›3m <size> ›0mare used;›3m
dec         ›0mthe function-offsets appear as decimal numbers;›3m
hex         ›0mthe offsets appear as hexadecimal numbers;

If you don't  specify  a Targetname/-path,  the includefile  will be created in
your current directory.
If you neither select ›3m spaces ›0mnor›3m tabs ›0m (this is default),  the equals sign and
the offset will be directly put next to each functionname  (no space).  If both
switches are set,  the program prefers tabulators and a space is set after each
equals sign. When formatting the file, ›1mfd2AsmInc›0m calculates the position of the
equals sign in a manner  that they all appear  in the same column  and there is
the smallest possible  space between  the longest functionname  and the  equals
sign.
While the program works,  the filenames are listet in two columns:  on the left
there are the names of the .fd-files - on the right there are the includefiles.
Two dots after a filename mean  that this file is currently worked with.  If an
error accurs,  its description is printed next to the filename  (if there is an
syntax error in  the .fd-file  the number of  the errorline is also displayed).
The includefile is tried to be deleted, if it was already opened, and a message
is printed (in case of success). If the parameter›3m from ›0mcontained wildcards, the
program asks, if you want to continue with the converting process.  By the way,
you can stop the program by pressing CTRL+C.

›42m-- Technical stuff ------------------------------------------------------- 4 --›0m

Here's some background information for the guys who want to know everything:
- ›1mfd2AsmInc›0m is programmed reentrant and PC-relative (with AsmOne v1.02);
- the length of a functionname (incl.›3m _LVO›0m) may not be greater that›3m $ffff›0m;
-›3m ##private, ##public, ##base ›0mand other›3m ##xxx ›0mare ignored;
-›3m ##bias ›0mand›3m ##end ›0mare recognized, if they contain upper-case letters;
- the program refuses to work properly on A600 machines :-)
-›3m RETURN_FAIL ›0mis returned in case of an error,›3m RETURN_WARN ›0min case of›3m ***break›0m;
- the program contains a versionstring;
- the hexadecimal offsets appear in lower-case in the include-file;
- ***
- the continue-request checks, if you enter 'y' or 'Y';
- tabulators are recognized (like spaces);
- if the .fd-file contains no›3m ##bias›0m, an offset of›3m NULL ›0mis used;
- .fd-files that don't contain an›3m ##end ›0mdon't cause an error;
- if›3m from ›0mcontains wildcards and›3m to ›0mdoesn't exist, (as opposed to c:copy) no
  target-directory is created;
- you can suck the rest out of the sourcecode;

›42m-- Concluding words ------------------------------------------------------ 5 --›0m

Well, that's it.  I don't know any features for the future - ok,  you could in-
clude an›3m ALL›0m-Option  and a›3m FROM/M ›0m and create a target directory,  if›3m from ›0mcon-
tains wildcards, but I think noone needs this (and I'm too lazy to include this
in my sourcecode).  If you  have  bugreports,  improvement-suggestions  or what
ever, write to:

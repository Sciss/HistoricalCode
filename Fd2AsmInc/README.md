This is a programming tool I wrote for the Commodore AMIGA in 12/1992â€“01/1993,
and it was published in January 1993 on the Fred Fish "Fish Disk" No. 802.

These files are preserved except for removing curse words and personal information.
The code was written with the AsmOne assembly language editor, targetting
the Motorola 68000 processor.

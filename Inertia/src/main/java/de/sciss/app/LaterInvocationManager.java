/**
 *  The LaterInvocationManager is a utility
 *  bastard synthesized from an EventManager
 *  and a Runnable. It's useful for queueing activities
 *  from outside the Swing event thread to be processed later
 *  in the event thread.
 *  <p>
 *  Note that in test scenarios on apple's VM, PreferenceChangeEvents
 *  were dispatched in a thread different from the normal Swing event
 *  thread. Due to this fact a lot of synchronization issues arise,
 *  so we decided to pass more or less all preference changes to a
 *  LaterInvocationManager.Listener instance...
 *
 *  @author		Hanns Holger Rutz
 *  @version	0.13, 15-Sep-05
 *
 *  @todo   conduct further research on the preference dispatching thread
 *			and the necessity to invoke processing on the swing thread

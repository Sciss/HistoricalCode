JWave
=====

Java implementation of a discrete fourier transform (DFT) algorithm, a fast wavelet transform (FWT)
algorithm, and a wavelet packet transform (WPT) algorithm in 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D.

The wavelet transform algorithms are using normalized orthogonal (orthonormal) Haar, Coiflet, Daubechies, and
Legendre wavelets as known by the multi-scale analysis. Furthermore the BiOrthogonal wavelet family, Symlets
and the Discrete Mayer FIR filter are available too.

The implementation of JWave is based on several Design Patterns and - hopefully - appears user-friendly.
However, have a look at the Wiki pages for a usage info.

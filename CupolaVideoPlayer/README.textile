h3. requirements / installation

Currently "Xuggler":http://xuggle.com/xuggler/ is used for playback. The viewer seems pretty unstable though, so this might change. To prepare Xuggler, make sure the following environment variables are set (e.g. in @~/.bash_profile@):

pre. export XUGGLE_HOME=???
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$XUGGLE_HOME/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=$XUGGLE_HOME/bin:$PATH

Make symlinks for the Xuggler libraries into the manually managed @lib@ folder. Here is how mine look:

pre. commons-cli.jar -> ../../xuggler/share/java/jars/commons-cli.jar
logback-classic.jar -> ../../xuggler/share/java/jars/logback-classic.jar
logback-core.jar -> ../../xuggler/share/java/jars/logback-core.jar
slf4j-api.jar -> ../../xuggler/share/java/jars/slf4j-api.jar
xuggle-xuggler.jar -> ../../xuggler/share/java/jars/xuggle-xuggler.jar

Run the project from the shell via @sbt run@.

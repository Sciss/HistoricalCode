Bosque is a multitrack timeline editor for SuperCollider. It consists of a class library for SuperCollider language, and a Java library which is embedded via SwingOSC. Bosque can be used to programmatically create timeline structures in SuperCollider, and to control algorithmic processes by a timeline. Timeline objects include audio file regions, markers, function regions (which execute arbitrary code) and envelope automations.

Although Bosque is not any more actively developed (there is a successor project "Kontur" which will eventually have the full feature set of Bosque), the software is currently in good shape and fully documented.

h3. requirements / installation

The SuperCollider classes and help files work out of the box. Just copy them to the appropriate folders for SuperCollider, or make symlinks. E.g. on OS X, link the @SCClassLibrary@ folder into @~/Library/Application\ Support/SuperCollider/Extensions/SCClassLibrary/Bosque@ and the @Help@ folder into @~/Library/Application\ Support/SuperCollider/Extensions/Help/Bosque@.

The java library called "TimeBased" needs to be build initially. To do so, go into the "timebased" folder. You will need Java 1.5 and Apache ant, as well as a SwingOSC installation.

* make a symlink from your SwingOSC installation's @SwingOSC.jar@ into @libraries/@.
* build using @ant@ (it will run the default target)
* after a successful build you will find @TimeBased.jar@
* make a symlink from this @TimeBased.jar@ into your SuperCollider installation's extensions folder, e.g. on OS X, link into @~/Library/Application\ Support/SuperCollider/Extensions/@

To run, SuperCollider version 3.3 and SwingOSC v0.65 or any newer versions should be fine.

As a starting point, open the main help file for "Bosque".
